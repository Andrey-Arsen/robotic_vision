This project provides a simple pipeline to turn videos or images into beautiful 
3D scenes using two main tools: COLMAP and Gaussian Splatting. First, 
it reconstructs a point cloud from input frames using COLMAP. Then, it transforms 
the result into a format compatible with Gaussian Splatting to render high-quality, 
photorealistic views of the scene.
